# IMDb Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the Python implementation used for my MSc dissertation:
"Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews Using Artificial Intelligence".

The system analyses IMDb movie reviews using:
- TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- LSTM (Keras)

The dataset used is the IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset.
